When we launch kubernetes in cloud offerings like AWS EKS, Azure AKS and Google Kubernetes Engine they will have additional component which is Cloud Control Manager, which looks as below

Kubernetes cluster would contain 2 types of nodes.

`1. Kubernetes Master or Control Plane`
`2. Kubernetes Worker Nodes` (formerly known as Minions)

## Kubernetes Master or Control Plane.

Following components makes a server k8s master.

        `i. API server`
        `ii. Scheduler `
        `iii. Control Manager`
        `iv. Etcd`

## Kubernetes Worker Node.

Following are components part of Kubernetes worker nodes formerly knows as Minions.

         `i. kube-proxy `
         `ii. kubelet`
